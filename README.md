# Alchemist Adventures
Alchemist Adventures is a blog site about transforming or creating something through a seemingly **_magical_** process, i.e. cooking and baking, design and development, experiences and travel. The site features a custom built content-management system that allows you to create a new post, edit a post, and delete a post.
